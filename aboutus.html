       Southern Provincial Irrigation Department (SPID) came into being with the formation of Southern Provincial Council in 1989. The functions and duties of the province formerly carried out by the Central Irrigation Department were handed over to the newly formed Provincial Irrigation Department as per 13th amendment to the Constitution. According to the 13th amendment all non-inter-provincial irrigation schemes should be under the purview of the Provincial Department.

       In Galle and Matara, there are no inter-provincial irrigation schemes, whereas most major irrigation schemes in Hambantota are inter-provincial. Except for Hambantota, SPID plays a key role in irrigation development in the province. Hambantota, one of the driest districts, has over 800 minor tanks that store rainwater, benefiting farmers for paddy cultivation, other crops, and domestic needs. However, due to a lack of maintenance and oversight from governmental or non-governmental organizations, many of these tanks remain non-functional or underutilized.
